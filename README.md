This repository represents the contents of the nvim config directory, `~/.config/nvim`.
To enable LSP support, navigate to the file `./lua/drd00/autocmp_lsp.lua`, modify the line with `local install_lsp`,
setting this to `true`, then opening an nvim instance. After the LSP install, set this variable back to `false`.
